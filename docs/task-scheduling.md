# Task scheduling attributes

Absolute supports portable scheduling metadata on async functions and individual
`spawn` sites. Function defaults use `@task`; a declaration-level `@spawn`
overrides only the named fields for one launch:

```absolute
@task(core = 2, priority = 1, role = "worker")
async int32 calculate(int32 value) {
    return value * 2;
}

async int32 main() {
    @spawn(core = 4, priority = 3, role = "render")
    task<int32> result = spawn calculate(21);
    return await result;
}
```

- `core` is a zero-based logical processor index. `-1` disables affinity.
- `priority` is a portable task-queue priority from `-3` through `3`. Higher
  values are dequeued first; equal-priority work is fair across role lanes and
  FIFO inside each lane.
- `role` creates/selects a named scheduling lane and is available as a logical
  label while the task runs. Equal-priority lanes are serviced round-robin,
  while work inside one lane remains FIFO.

All arguments are named compile-time literals. `@task` is valid only on async
functions or methods. `@spawn` is valid only on a variable initialized directly
with `spawn`. An omitted field inherits the `@task` value; without either
attribute the defaults are `core = -1`, `priority = 0`, and an empty role.

The runtime applies and then restores native worker-thread affinity where the
host supports it. Unsupported or unavailable affinity requests do not prevent
the task from running; the requested logical core remains visible as metadata.
The `std/task.abs` module exposes `std.task.core()`, `priority()`, `role()`, and
`hasRole(...)` for the currently executing task.

## Scheduler v2 runtime

Native tasks run on stackful fibers owned by a bounded OS worker pool. Once a
fiber starts, it remains pinned to that worker so thread-local state is never
migrated between OS threads. Waiting for another task, a bounded channel,
`TransferChannel`, the runtime mutex, or `std.task.delay` suspends the fiber and
returns its worker to the scheduler. Completion, channel operations, mutex
unlock, and timer expiry enqueue the suspended task again.

The default pool size is the available hardware concurrency capped at 32.
`ABSOLUTE_SCHEDULER_WORKERS=1..32` overrides it before the first task is spawned;
`std.task.workerCount()` reports the selected value. This override is intended
for constrained hosts and deterministic scheduler tests.

Windows uses native Fibers. Linux and macOS use `ucontext`; Android/Termux uses
the Termux `libucontext` package installed by the project bootstrap script.
Blocking filesystem and network calls are not yet connected to an I/O reactor
and remain the next Scheduler v2 integration step.
